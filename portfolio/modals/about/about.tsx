          I'm currently <span className="neon-text">{calculateAge()}</span> years old (age updates automatically ðŸ˜‰)!

        <p className="mt-4">
          I was born and raised in <span className="neon-text">Melbourne, Australia</span> to an Iraqi family. I lived
          the majority of my childhood in a country Victorian town named Shepparton. Iâ€™ve always been a great problem
          solver, an independent learner and a technophile obsessed with the latest devices and tech. Today, Iâ€™m working
          as a software engineer and I get to show off all the elements of who I am.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus.
          After a college education in Criminology/IT Security, I continued to pursue my hobby and finished a degree in
          Computer Science. I realised software engineering was the right field for me.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Since then, I have worked on a countless number of projects and experienced hands on work with clients while
          making some great work buddies along the way. I love to learn, love to teach others and love to solve complex
          tasks which have never been tackled before. I describe myself as a technology agnostic person who can adapt to
          new tech super quickly.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Iâ€™m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including Javascript/Typescript, HTML, CSS, a variety of
          the latest JS Frameworks (Angular/React etc.), .NET & C#, Python, C++ but Iâ€™m always adding new skills to my
          repertoire. I'm a fanboy for automating manual tasks and most of all, I adore making a difference and being
          recognised as a passionate worker.
